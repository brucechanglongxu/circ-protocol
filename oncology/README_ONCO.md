# CIRC-Onco: An Agentic Protocol for Autonomous Coordination in Cancer Care

CIRC-Onco is the oncology‐focused extension of the CIRC protocol, designed to let cancer-specific AI agents collaborate safely across diagnosis, treatment planning, scheduling, and comorbidity management without replacing the EHR.  Building on the core CIRC routing and audit layer, CIRC-Onco adds domain-tailored agents—PathologyAgent, TreatmentPlanAgent, SchedulingAgent, and DiabetesCareAgent—and a policy file that maps tumor markers (e.g., HER2, KRAS, PD-L1) or ICD codes to the agents permitted to act.  Each message between agents carries a FHIR bundle plus CIRC metadata for provenance, governance, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints, creating a transparent audit trail that satisfies institutional safety requirements while automating repetitive coordination tasks.

The initial proof-of-concept targets two bottlenecks in breast-oncology workflows.  When a synthetic HER2-positive biopsy result arrives, PathologyAgent publishes a CIRC task that TreatmentPlanAgent converts into a NCCN-aligned trastuzumab regimen; SchedulingAgent then reserves infusion and imaging slots, all under a policy that blocks unsupervised medication orders and requires physician e-signature before anything touches the real EHR.  A parallel diabetes-care flow demonstrates comorbidity coordination: DiabetesCareAgent detects an elevated HbA1c in the same patient, triggers a consult to endocrinology, and adjusts chemotherapy timing in concert with SchedulingAgent.  In shadow-mode simulation the pipeline completes these steps in seconds, generating a full audit log for review.

CIRC-Onco’s broader value is as an open, reproducible testbed for cancer-oriented multi-agent research.  Investigators can plug in new agents—radiology triage, prior-auth drafting, toxicity monitoring—by registering capabilities and permissions in YAML, then observe how they interoperate under real governance constraints.  This modular architecture positions CIRC-Onco as a lightweight but extensible foundation for Yosemite’s vision of scalable, technology-enabled oncology care, accelerating translation from single-agent demos to clinically governed, multi-agent ecosystems that reduce delays, cut clerical burden, and improve precision treatment delivery.Ask ChatGPT
